# SortingMetrics
Hello There!

This is a personal project where I will be implementing a large variety of sorting algorithms in a program and measuring their execution times.

This project stems from personal curiosity as well as a desire to sharpen my algorithmic skills and knowledge of the C language. I will be deriving the source code from scratch by analyzing the algorithms step by step in an effort to retain the information.

I have no real deadline or schedule for this project, but intend to complete it in a reasonable amount of time because of the different career advantages to be had by knowing the algorithms, strengths, and weaknesses of each sort.

#### Simple Sorts (Will likely all be in the same file):
- [x] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Insertion Sort
- [x] Selection Sort
- [ ] Shell Sort
- [ ] Cocktail Sort

#### Advanced Sorts (Will likely have their own files):
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] Heap Sort
- [ ] Radix Sort
- [ ] Counting Sort
