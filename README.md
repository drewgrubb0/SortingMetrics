# SortingMetrics
And this project is done!
This project was very interesting for me because I learned a lot about different sorting algorithms, their implementations, and when to use them!

A couple things that stood out to me:
- All of the quick algorithms were much faster than I anticipated on large number sequences
- Shell sort was much faster than I expected
- Heap sort was slower than I expected
- Counting sort is a monster I didn't expect (but looking back on it makes sense because it's almost similar to a hashmap)

Things I want to do with this in the future:
- [ ] Port it over to an Object Oriented Language (most likely C++) to create a cleaner main method and make it even easier to implement new algorithms.
- [ ] Add more customizable features in said port such as running individual sorts, running specific groups, or rerunning sorts.
- [ ] Add more things to keep track of (#Comparisons, #Swaps, Sort specific stats).
- [ ] Possibly take advantage of Linux Perf to look even further as to specific sorting statistics

Hello There!

This is a personal project where I will be implementing a large variety of sorting algorithms in a program and measuring their execution times.

This project stems from personal curiosity as well as a desire to sharpen my algorithmic skills and knowledge of the C language. I will be deriving the source code from scratch by analyzing the algorithms step by step in an effort to retain the information.

I have no real deadline or schedule for this project, but intend to complete it in a reasonable amount of time because of the different career advantages to be had by knowing the algorithms, strengths, and weaknesses of each sort.

#### Simple Sorts (Will likely all be in the same file):
- [x] Bubble Sort
- [x] Insertion Sort
- [x] Selection Sort
- [x] Shell Sort
- [x] Cocktail Sort

#### Advanced Sorts (Will likely have their own files):
- [x] Merge Sort
- [x] Quick Sort
- [x] Heap Sort
- [x] Radix Sort
- [x] Counting Sort
